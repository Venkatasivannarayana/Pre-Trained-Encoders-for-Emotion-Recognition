# Pre-Trained-Encoders-for-Emotion-Recognition
## 1. Introduction 
In this project we present our approach for how to improve emotion recognition in text by using BERT and RoBERTa Pre-trained Transformer models. 
## 2. Dataset
https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1UeIK2K2Ig1OULwAbAiTnesL1uAYxkXvx
1. Add this shortcut to drive
2. This will allow us to link between Dataset and Drive.

## 3. How to Use?
There are two google colab files in the Github. 
1. Venkat_BERT_Emotion_Detection_Text.ipynb
https://github.com/Venkatasivannarayana/Pre-Trained-Encoders-for-Emotion-Recognition/blob/main/Venkat_BERT_Emotion_Detection_Text.ipynb
2. Venkat_RoBERTa_Emotion_Detection_Text.ipynb
https://github.com/Venkatasivannarayana/Pre-Trained-Encoders-for-Emotion-Recognition/blob/main/Venkat_RoBERTa_Emotion_Detection_Text.ipynb
3. Each of the notebook files must be open using google colab and they should be run independently after adding the shortcut of provided dataset in the google drive.
4. https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1UeIK2K2Ig1OULwAbAiTnesL1uAYxkXvx
5. There are data and dev files in goemotion folder
